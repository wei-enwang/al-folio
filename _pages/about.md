I am a M.Eng. student at MIT. Currently doing research at the [Data to AI lab](https://dai.lids.mit.edu/people/) under the supervision of Dr. Kalyan Veeramachaneni.
I received my B.S. in EECS and B.S. in Physics from MIT in June, 2023. My research aims to help people understand time-series ML models through explanation algorithms. I am also broadly interested in using statistical models to convert meaningful real-world problems. Specifically, enabling the use of AI in healthcare with the aid of field knowledge and explanation algorithms.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing video games, board games, basketball and baseball.
