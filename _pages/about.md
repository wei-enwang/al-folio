I will graduate with my M.Eng. degree at MIT in February 2024. I did research at the [Data to AI lab](https://dai.lids.mit.edu/people/) under the supervision of Dr. Kalyan Veeramachaneni. My research aims to help people understand time-series ML models through explanation algorithms. I am also broadly interested in using statistical models to convert meaningful real-world problems. Specifically, enabling the use of AI in healthcare with the aid of field knowledge and explanation algorithms.
I received my B.S. in EECS and B.S. in Physics from MIT in June, 2023.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing basketball, board games and video games.
